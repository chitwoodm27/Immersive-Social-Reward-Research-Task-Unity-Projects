Materials and Methods:
	- Unity Engine (2019.4.16f1)
	- Unity Hub
		**Link to download Unity & Unity Hub: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
	- SMI Eye Tracking (Software used to record eye data) 
		**The versions of the Unity projects provided are already set up with SMI software. However, if you have a preferred eye tracking software and it can be integrated with Unity projects, then it should work on these tasks. If you would like to have the Unity projects without SMI integration, please contact me and I can provide them.
	- PC, Mac & Linux Standalone Platform (Build Platform for each Unity project)
		**The Platform can be switched in the Build Settings of Unity, for example, to Android or to iOS
	- Head-mounted display (HMD)
		** Although we used the HTC Vive to test these projects, they can be displayed on any device whether it be an HMD, computer, phone, tablet, etc.
